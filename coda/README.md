# Coda
Use clips in coda to dramatically increase typing efficiency.

Type any of the short codes listed below followed by the `tab` key to generate a snippet of code. Some of the short codes focus your cursor into a specific part of the code to allow you to seamlessly continue typing.

For example, if you type `fn` then press the `tab` key, you will receive the following code snippet.
```
function () {
    
}
```
Your cursor will be focused immediately in front of the parenthesis `()` so you can immediately start typing the function name.
```
function myFunction() {
    // huzahh!
}
```
