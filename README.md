### Terminal

* In the app settings, set the **Profile** to `Pro` and the **font size** to `18`
* In the app settings, set the `Pro` theme as `default`
* Import [`.zshrc`](https://github.com/mattmilburn/config/blob/master/.zshrc) contents into `~/.zshrc`
* Import [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/mattmilburn/config/blob/master/.gitconfig) contents into `~/.gitconfig`


## Apps and Coding Environment

### Homebrew

Install Homebrew.
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```


### Install apps

Navigate to same location as the `Brewfile` and run:
```
brew bundle
```


### Setup `nvm`
Create the directory for `.nvm` if it does not already exist.
```
mkdir ~/.nvm
```

Add this to the end of your `~/.zshrc` file.
```
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
```

Now, either restart the terminal or run:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

Finally, install whichever version of Node is needed:
```
nvm install 18.18.0
```
